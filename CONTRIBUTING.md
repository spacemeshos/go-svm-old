# Getting Started
- Browse [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-svm/labels/help%20wanted) and [good first issues](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-svm/labels/good%20first%20issue).
- Still not sure? Get yourself familiar with the codebase by writing some tests. We never have enough of them.

# Contributors Compensation
- We believe in compensating contributors and collaborators for their open source contributions.
- We are experimenting with bounties and we plan to announce additional compensation plans in the near future.
- We are using [gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co) for compensating contributors with Ethereum cryptocoins for some open issues.
- Browse our open bounties [here](https://gitcoin.co/profile/spacemeshos).

# Working on an existing issue
- Make sure that the issue is labeled `Help Wanted` before starting to work on it.
- Add a comment in the issue that you are starting to work on it.
- Ask for any information that you feel is missing from the issue for you to be able to work on it.
- Clone branch `develop` and not `master` - we follow [gitflow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html).
- Create a new PR (Pull Request) from your cloned and reference the issue number in it.
- Submit your PR when you believe your code is ready for code review.
- Follow up on code review comments by one of the project maintainers on your Pull Request (PR)
- You may add your name and email to AUTHORS when submitting your Pull Request.

# Creating a new issue
- Scan both open and closed issues and verify that your new feature idea, improvement proposal or bug report is not already addressed in another issue.
- Before starting to work on a large contribution please chat with the core dev team on our Gitter channel to get some initial feedback prior to doing lots of work.
- If your feature idea is already discussed in an open issue then join the conversation on the issue and suggest your proposed design or approach. Coordinate with others who actively work on this issue.
- If an existing closed or open issue not found then create a new repo issue. Describe your idea for new feature or for an improvement of an existing feature and the design of the code you'd like to contribute.
- Wait for feedback from one of the maintainers before starting to work on the feature or the bug fix. We provide feedback on all issue comments in up to 24 hours.

# Code Guidelines
Please follow these guidelines for your PR to be reviewed and be considered for merging into the project.

2. Provide at least one unit test for each function and method.
3. Provide at least one integration test for each feature with a flow which involves more than one function call. Your tests should reflect the main ways that your code should be used.
4. Use [rustfmt](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt)
5. Make sure that all CI tasks pass.


# Working on a funded issue

## Step 1 - Discover :sunrise_over_mountains:
- Browse the [open funded issues](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-svm/labels/funded) in our GitHub repo, or on our [gitcoin.io funded issues page](https://gitcoin.co/profile/spacemeshos).
- Skip issues that another contributor is already actively working on.
- Find a funded issue you'd like to be working on.
- Ask any questions you may have about the work involved in the issue GitHub page comments section.
- Click the `Start Work` button on the gitcoin.io issue page when you are ready to start working on the issue.

- If you claim an issue and become unresponsive for more than 7 days then we might encourage other contributors to claim it.

## Step 3 - Get paid :moneybag:
- When ready, submit your PR for review and go through the code review process with one of our maintainers.
